    <p><h4>What Does Web Mean?</h4>
        The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, 
        a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can 
        be accessed by a Web browser. 
        Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, 
        and use these terms interchangeably. 
        However, the term Internet actually 
        refers to the global network of servers 
        that makes the information sharing that happens 
        over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make 
        up a large portion of the Internet, 
        but they are not one and same.</p>
